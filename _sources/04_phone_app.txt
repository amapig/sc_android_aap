APhone Application used in Demo
===============================

[1] http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html#running-demokit

Note that there is no contribution (yet) from XMOS to the phone application. Please follow guidelines in the above link. This phone application is designed for other boards and such baords can make full use of this application. Since, we are using the development board our ability to use the entire phone application feature is limited (but not impossible). Samsung Google Nexus was selected as target platform while following these steps and the Android version was 2.3.6.

Once the DemoKit application is installed on the phone, it's icon will appear along with other (installed) phone application icons.
